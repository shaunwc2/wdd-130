        There aren't many things that are required for our reunion,
          but the snack shack is one of them. Everyone brings a treat of some
          kind to add to the hoard of food. One of the mandatory snacks is
          buckets of cheese balls that no one eats but will still end up at
          Jan's house in the end.

      <h3>Future</h3>
      <p>
        Ever since 1995 we have been gathering for 3 days a year in July. The first reunion was held because Grandma and Grandpa were on their mission to New Zeland and the siblings wanted to make sure they would still get together. The only year that has been missed was in 2020 during the covid pandemic. Since the first reunion our numbers have grown by over 110 people. We havenâ€™t gotten sick of each other yet and are looking forward to many more years.

        Colleen's family is in charge this year.
        It will be hosted in Grandma's back yard in Iona Idaho.
        We currently don't have an agenda but that will be sent out by the end of March with family assignments. As always make sure to bring sunscreen we are excited to see everyone.
